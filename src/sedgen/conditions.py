# This script should contain default boundary conditions such as:
#     - Temperature
#     - pH
#     - Precipitation
#     - Relief
# for different environments.

# These boundary conditions will mainly have an effect on the mechanical
# and chemical weathering rates and therefore indirectly on the
# mechanical vs chemical weathering ratio.

# The possibility to add new environments by the user could also be
# taken up at a later stage.
